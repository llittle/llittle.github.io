## Substitutions and Notes
- Forgot to add 1 tbl sugar! 
- Used salted butter instead of oil
- Used Elmdorf Wapsi Valley Rustic Polenta for the cornmeal. Not sure how course/fine of a grian that is supposed to be
- Cooked in my cast iron skillet
- Added 3m to cooking time (33m total), and it came out with a great dark crust and golden top

Made this for another recipe, but took time to try out a slice first- delicious! 

Fine without the sugar, although it wouldn't have hurt. Good flavor and I love the crust you get with the cast iron.
