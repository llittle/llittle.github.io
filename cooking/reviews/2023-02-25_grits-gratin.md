## Results
Took a while to make this recipie since you had to make the grits, let them cool, then also bake the cassarole. However I think it was worth it. 

The grits with the greens was surprisingly good. The spinach didn't quite hold up well to the baking, I think using a heartier green as the recipe suggests is a good idea (shocking), but I had spinach I wanted to use up and honestly I would probably make it like this again.


The dish was surprisingly vinegar-y, (lemon juice would have been very nice here), I might reduce the recipe to only have 1 teaspoon instead of two.

To be honest I had never made grits from straight cormeal before, only from 'Grits' boxes, so that was a fun experience.
