## Substitutions and Notes
- Red wine vinegar not lemon juice
- used both cilantro and basil

## Results
I was really skeptical about the recipe since seems pretty different. However ended up being really good. 
I liked that it was so heavy with the fresh herbs and tomatoes, tasted very fresh with just a hint of spice. 
The vinegar wasn't a very predominant flavor, which was good, and the cornbread and tomatoes had a good textural offset to each other.

Would have been good to cut the cornbread into slightly smaller pieces (I did about 1x1")

One recipe makes 3 large servings.
